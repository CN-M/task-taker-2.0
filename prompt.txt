Make me a README for my fullstack project. It's called Task Taker 2.0. It's a Todo List application where users can view their tasks, create new ones, delete ones, and mark ones complete.
I have 3 screenshots of the login, register, and dashboard pages. Place placeholders for these screenshots where most necessary.

It uses Vite, Typescript, Tailwind CSS, and React on the frontend, using Zustand for state management.
It uses Zod for form validations and sanitizing of user input data.

It uses Node, Typescript, and Express for the backend. It uses PostgreSQL as a database, with Prisma as an ORM.
It has middleware for protecting routes, checking each request for access tokens and refreshing expired ones, and it uses Zod for validating data coming from the frontend.

It uses email and password for authentication. Users can register, login, and logout. It uses Bcrypt for hashing passwords and issues JWT (jsonwebtoken) access tokens and makes use of localstorage. 
It also uses cookies for storing JWT refresh tokens for refreshing expired access tokens and keeping a user logged in.

It uses pnpm as its package manager.

This is what the tree folder structure looks like:
├── README.md
├── client
│   ├── README.md
│   ├── index.html
│   ├── package.json
│   ├── pnpm-lock.yaml
│   ├── postcss.config.js
│   ├── public
│   ├── src
│   ├── tailwind.config.js
│   ├── tsconfig.json
│   ├── tsconfig.node.json
│   └── vite.config.ts
├── package.json
├── pnpm-lock.yaml
├── prompt.txt
└── server
    ├── config
    ├── controllers
    ├── middleware
    ├── package.json
    ├── pnpm-lock.yaml
    ├── prisma
    ├── routes
    ├── server.ts
    └── tsconfig.json

Write these instructions in step by step:
to get started clone the repo, run npm i in both client and server directories. 
add .env and its variables. Use .env.example as a blue print. Here are the contents of .env.example:
PORT="3000"
SECRET="IL0v3CupC@k3s"
REFFRESH_SECRET="IL0v3CupC@k3sT00"
NODE_ENV="development"
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://johndoe:randompassword@localhost:5432/mydb?schema=public"

hint: use the command 'openssl rand -base64 32' to generate random SECRET and REFFRESH_SECRET.

It has 3 pages. Login '/login', register '/register', dashboard '/'.


https://github.com/CN-M/Task-Taker-2.0.git is the repo and I am CN-M.

Try not to make the README too long. Thanks, ChatGPT!


just some extra info really quick. Because it uses Prisma, the person cloning this will have to add the DATABASE_URL and then run prisma migrate dev.
By default the backend is on localhost 3000 and the frontend on localhost 5173.
and here are some scripts that can be run at the root of Tasker-taker-2.0 to run the whole thing at once
test": "vitest",
    "client": "pnpm run --prefix client dev",
    "server": "pnpm run --prefix server dev",
